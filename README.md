# promptdna-public
Public documentation, roadmap, and architecture notes for PromptDNA — a SaaS for prompt extraction, remixing, and provenance across image and video workflows.
# PromptDNA

PromptDNA is a paid SaaS that helps creators, teams, and AI-native businesses extract, remix, and reuse prompts from images and video frames — turning visual outputs into reusable prompt intelligence.

## Why PromptDNA
Most AI-generated content loses its prompt forever. PromptDNA restores that context, enabling faster iteration, consistency, and scale across creative workflows.

## What’s Live
- Image-to-prompt extraction
- Prompt remixing and reuse
- Credit-based rendering system
- Creator-first workflows

## What’s Coming
See the public roadmap in `ROADMAP.md`.
